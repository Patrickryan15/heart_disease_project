# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Project Description
This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease in individuals based on various health and demographic factors. Using a dataset that includes attributes like age, sex, cholesterol levels, and more, I employed machine learning models to identify patterns and predict outcomes related to heart disease.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project consists of several medical and demographic features that are commonly associated with heart disease risk. Each entry represents an individual's health record, including both numerical and categorical data points.

## Environment and Libraries
To run this project, you'll need a Python environment with the following libraries:
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation and evaluation.

Python version: Preferably Python 3.8 or above.

## Installation
To set up your environment for running this notebook, please follow these steps:
1. Ensure that Python and pip are installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository or download the Jupyter notebook.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the cells in sequence from top to bottom.

## Methodology
The project follows a standard machine learning pipeline:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the data to understand the relationships and identify patterns.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features that contribute to the predictive model.
4. **Model Training**: Implementing and training various machine learning models.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using cross-validation and selecting the best-performing model.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tuning the model to improve performance.
7. **Final Evaluation**: Assessing the tuned model on a separate test set.

## Results
The project includes a comparison of different machine learning models based on their performance metrics. The best-performing model is then fine-tuned for optimal results. The final model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
